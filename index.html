        <h2 class="subtitle">Myths and Legends of the Moon</h2>
            <p class="inner">The moon is, in terms of distance, the closest heavenly body to earth. We can see it in the sky for three weeks out of four, and for thousands of years, people have used its light to guide them in the dark. In addition to the personification of the moon as deity, there are all kinds of fascinating legends and myths associated with the moon and its cycles.<br>Did you know that the word lunatic comes from the Latin luna, because it was believed that people were more likely to exhibit aberrant behavior during a full moon? Although studies have been done showing that emergency room visits and accidents are increased during the full moon period, there has yet to be conclusive evidence for causation.<br>The moon seems to have an effect on animals as well as people. Dr. Frank Brown of Northwestern University, an expert on animal behavior, reports that hamsters spin in their wheels far more aggressively during the moon's full phase. Deer and other herbivores in the wild tend to ovulate at the full moon, and in Australia's Great Barrier Reef, the full moon is mating time for coral.<br>The Strange Case of Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde, by Robert Louis Stevenson, was allegedly inspired by Charles Hyde, a London man who supposedly committed a series of crimes at the time of the full moon... except scholars have found no existence of this man, and the claim seems to have originated in the 1950s in a Readers Digest story. However, even if Hyde didn't exist, there are true crime stories of people who killed during the full moon in multiple months.<br>There is a British legend that if Christmas fell on the day of a dark Moon, the following year's harvest would be a bountiful one. Some parts of the British Isles believed that a waxing moon on Christmas meant a good crop the next fall, but a waning moon indicated a bad one would come.<br>In some countries, a halo around the moon means bad weather is coming. From a folkloric standpoint, however, many traditions of weather magic indicate that a lunar halo means rain, snow, or other foul atmospheric conditions are on the way. Related to the lunar halo is the phenomenon called a moonbow.<br>Interestingly, because of the way light refracts, a moonbow – which is just like a rainbow, but appearing at night – will only be seen in the part of the sky opposite of where the moon is visible.

The antelope chase Coyote, who tosses the moon into a river each night, just out of reach of the antelope</li>
